## What:

This is a weekly peer learning group for sharing skills and best practices for
research computing and data science. In these friendly sessions, peers at all levels
of experience share topics useful in our data analysis and software development
workflows.

This meeting would be a great venue for introducing new libraries,
showing off useful features of a data processing/analysis/visualization library or programming
language you're using, or bringing up a computational problem you're
having.

## Who:

Anyone interested how to learn and do things by programming computers is
welcome to come to our meetings. You don't need to be affiliated with
the University of Birmingham and you don't need to come every week. There is
no set of pre-requsites, although we frequently use bash and the command line,
python, R, GitHub, and Jupyter notebooks.

## Where:

We meet at {{ site.meet_time }} in {{ site.meet_place }}.

## When:

We meet at {{ site.meet_time }}.  We start officially at that time, but do
join us for a friendly chat from 15 minutes before if you like.  While the
main session should occupy less than an hour, the lightning talks and hacking
session usually go on until 90 minutes after the start time. See the [upcoming
topics list]({{ site.url }}/upcoming.html) or the
[calendar](http://bit.ly/1cqFKuh) for the topic for this week.

## How:

### Communications

* [Mailing list](mailto:hacker-within@lists.bham.ac.uk)

### Participating:

Participating is really easy.

*   At **{{ site.meet_time }}**, we gather and go through a round of
    introductions. New faces are always appearing!
*   Next, a volunteer will give a **tutorial** or lead a
    **discussion** about a computational topic. This topic can be anything
    useful, new, or interesting to scientists who compute. It may be some new
    skill you have recently picked up in your research, a productivity tool
    you have recently learned to love, an overview of a useful library, or
    anything you feel we would enjoy learning.
*   Finally, there will be a time for a couple of **Lightning Talks**, which
    are 5-10 minute blasts of information about a particular topic or question
    of interest to the group.

    **Note** that the lightning talk time is a good way to bring a question to
    the group. If you have a bug you need help with, here's the place to ask
    many ears about it at once.

## Why:

The tenets of scientiÔ¨Åc endeavor (e.g., data control, reproducibility,
comprehensive documentation, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail
to make use of current development tools such as unit testing, version
control, automated documentation, and others.

To avoid these pitfalls, this weekly meeting exists for sharing skills and best practices for
computational scientific applications. This group is modeled after The
Hacker Within, which  began as a student organization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and
is now reborn as a collection of such chapters around the world. Each of
the chapters convenes a community of scientists, at all levels of their
education and training, to share their knowledge and best practices in
using computing to accomplish their work.
