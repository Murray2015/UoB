We usually have a "what to learn and teach" session the first week of the semester. This is a nice time for us to get together, do a round of introductions, see what we want to learn and teach, and then try to set as much of the schedule for the semester as we can. I'll also be sharing results from the topics survey, which are [here in this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/thehackerwithin/berkeley/blob/master/code_examples/survey_f17/survey.ipynb).
