In this session, we will attempt to teach Bash (i.e. the Unix shell, the thing that you have on your Mac that opens when you click Terminal) from an introductory to an intermediate/advanced level. Windows users: some versions of Windows 10 have a Linux subsystem, but you can also install [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/) to follow along.

We'll start from basics of the shell and attempt to get all the way to some advanced stuff (I'm being vague on purpose; we'll stop and answer questions so that might determine our endpoint).

Invite your friends, especially those who are scared of command line interfaces but still want to know things! We'll be in BIDS / 190 Doe Library starting at 5pm on Wednesday. As always, we're a come when you can / leave when you need to sort of group, but we hope to see you there.
