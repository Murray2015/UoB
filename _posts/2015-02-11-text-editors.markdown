## Everyone

This week will be a session full of lightning talks. All of the members of THW
are encouraged to bring a lightning talk introducing some aspect of their
favorite (or not their favorite) text editor.

## Matthew Brett : Why Invest in a Text Editor?

Use a single editor well. "The Pragmatic Programmer" (Andrew Hunt & DAvid Thomas).  Vim/Emacs are productive if you do it well.

What is the cost to a scientist of being a bad programmer?

Maybe the good motivators are: taking it on faith, by watching others, and increasing efficiency of thought.

Matthew wants to do a study!!! It's going to be cool


## Joey Curtis : Atom

Joey shared this [text editor smackdown](http://www.sitepoint.com/sitepoint-smackdown-atom-vs-brackets-vs-light-table-vs-sublime-text/)
blogpost with us. He's now going to show off a few things about
[Atom](https://atom.io/).

Atom is a lot like sublimetext. Atom is GitHub's text editor and it's completely open source underneath, built on node.js.

On GitHub, there are tons of available packages to extend the program. There
are tons of papers, even, on how people prefer to look at code (colors,
appearence, eyestrain). The things that are successful are somewhat based on
Sublimetext, which, in turn, is based on Atom.

## Katy Huff : Vim-LaTeX

Vi (vim) has a lot of plugins. Katy's favorite way to discover plugins is
[VimAwesome](http://vimawesome.com). Her favorite way to then to install most
of those plugins is something called
[vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

Among all of these plugins, the one that has made the most difference in the
life of Katy is [vim-latex](http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/). She owes this
knowledge to the great and wonderful RedBeard (@mrterry).


## Donny : IPython Notebook

Check it out, you get a beautiful IPython prompt, you have the ability to edit
cells with markdown, get python documentation, quickly interact with plots and
whatnot.

Literate programming is the name of the game here. It's a nice way to prototype
code.


## Chris Paciorek : LyX

LyX is a WYSIWYG-style LaTeX. You can do things like type "frac" and then
"space" and it shows up beautifully rendered. It avoids the intermediate step
of building the LaTeX file.


## Sven Chilton : Emacs

The default emacs in macOSX isn't the best. You should install the new version.
The Ctrl-x is the key feature. You do that to execute various commands. "Ctrl-x
3" gets you a vertical screen. Lots of other things get shown off.... opening a
file.


## Anders Priest : Vim

Anders uses vim mostly in insert mode, but has recently started beefing up his
vimrc. He went to vimdoc.sourceforge.net and learned more about all the
options.

- Colorschemes go in the colors folder.
- You can use the cursor in insert mode if you "set mouse=i"
- You can show the numbers or not show the numbers.
- You can use mapping functions. Anders did this to make it so he can delete a
line even from insert mode.


## Cameron Bates : Textmate

Mac only text editor. It supports the all powerful command+ and command- view
changers.

- It is one of the first of the standalone text editors.
- There aren't many changes anymore, as it's quite mature and stable.
- Cameron uses it mostly for editing large files.
- It also can let you search within a folder, rather than just in one file.
- Search and replace, therefore, is nice and safe.

## Kyle Barbary : Emacs line-wrapping

If you hit alt-q it will reflow the text to make it wrap nicely.


## Caroline Sofiatti : Sublimetext

It's beautiful and a lot like Atom. Sublime has a beautiful rendering of the
whole file.
