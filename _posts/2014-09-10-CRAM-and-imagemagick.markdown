# Discussion of Next Week

Proposed future talk(s) from Jasmina: Series of “how to” talks— how to find and 
install your software, how to set up your environments, etc. 

It was decided that next week's Nuclear Talk should be Serpent Tutorial and How 
to Approach a Bug: Alejandra Jolodosky

The non-nuclear talk should be Introduction to LaTex (how you should interface 
with Tex on your respective OS). How to format your paper, image additions, and 
managing citations. : Katy can do this.
