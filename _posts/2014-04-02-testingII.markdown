# Lesson: Introduction to Testing

Katy gave a very quick continuation of testing in the context of languages other 
than python. She mostly did a tour through the Cyclus code and its tests, 
written using the google test framework and built into an executable with CMake.

# Lightning Talks

Ross Barnowski gave a quick overview of how to mount remote drives on a linux or 
unix platform.
