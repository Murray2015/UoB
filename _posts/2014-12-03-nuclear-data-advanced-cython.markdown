# Nuclear Data at LANL - Morgan White

We have a distinguished visitor for the last meeting of the semester. Morgan 
will give us some thoughts on Nuclear Data at Los Alamos.


## Morgan White

Morgan White joined the nuclear data team at LANL in X-division in 1998 as a 
summer student and has been part of that team ever since. Recently, Morgan has 
crossed from simulations to the dark side and begun working with the 
experimental community to better understand and reduce the systematic errors in 
the fundamental data necessary for such simulations.

# Advanced Cython - Cameron Bates

Code examples can be found [here][code].

## Cameron Bates

Cameron is a PhD candidate in Nuclear Engineering who works as a graduate 
student researcher on nuclear data experiment and simulation at Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory.
