Tony is going to be using [dply.co](https://dply.co) to walk us through containers, which lets you set up a free cloud server for 2 hours. If you want to walk it on your own laptop, you need to have a github account, an SSH key, and link the SSH key to your github account (see [this help page](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/) for instructions on that).

If you can create a server on dply.co and connect to it with the SSH key, then you'll be good to go. If not, come a few minutes early and we can help you get set up.

Talk slides are available [here](https://1drv.ms/p/s!Ak4iGlIIdzDHimHLxa15FHjuOnO7).
